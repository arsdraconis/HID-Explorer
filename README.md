HID-Explorer
============

A tool for exploring HID devices on OS X.

This is a quick and dirty utility that gives different
details about HID devices under OS X. It depends on HIDKit,
my Objective-C wrapper around the OS X HID Manager. As such,
this serves as something of a test of HIDKit.

I don't mean for this to be more than something for me to
hack on, but if you find use for it, let me know.
